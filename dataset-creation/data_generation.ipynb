The pain is a knife stroke in my upper chest, breast (R) and breast (L).

I have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some family members have had a pneumothorax.### Assistant: Based on your history, the two most likely diagnoses are unstable angina at 26.2% probability, and spontaneous pneumothorax at 6% probability.
